Partial implementation of a Galaga like shoot-em-up game.

At some point I had implemented some attack behavior of the enemies. But as always, the confusion in my head lead to crappy code. So at some later point I decided to delete this stuff.

h1. Dependencies

* linux like environment

* git 1.6 or later
* ruby 1.8 or later
* rake 0.8.3 or later
* jruby 1.0 or later
* java 1.5 or later
* ant 1.5 or later
* wtk 2.5 or later (for running the application in the emulator)

h1. Notes

JRuby is used for the font sizer script.

You may want to install rake and rspec within JRuby, too.
